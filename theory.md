It’s called Version Control because its main job is to control (manage) different versions of files (especially code, documents, or data) over time.

🔍 Breaking it down:
"Version" refers to a specific state or snapshot of your file(s) at a particular point in time.

"Control" means you can:

Create new versions

Track what changed between versions

Name or tag versions (e.g., "v1.0", "release-2024")

Revert to old versions if needed

Merge changes from multiple contributors
